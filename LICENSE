Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below.
The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are
not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

Creative Commons licenses are irrevocable. Once a creator applies a
Creative Commons license to material, it cannot be revoked.

This license allows reusers to copy and distribute the material in any
medium or format in unadapted form only, for noncommercial purposes
only, and only so long as attribution is given to the creator.
